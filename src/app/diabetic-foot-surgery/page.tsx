              <h3>How do I know if I need foot surgery?</h3>
              <p>
                Surgery is typically considered when non-surgical treatments haven't been effective, when there's significant 
                infection, when there's a risk of limb loss, or when deformities are causing ongoing problems. Dr. Prayas Kumar will 
                thoroughly evaluate your condition and discuss all treatment options with you.

              <h3>What is the recovery time after diabetic foot surgery?</h3>
              <p>
                Recovery time varies depending on the type of surgery, the extent of the condition, and individual factors 
                like blood sugar control and overall health. Generally, recovery can take anywhere from a few weeks to several 
                months. Dr. Prayas Kumar will provide you with specific expectations based on your situation.

              <h3>Will I be able to walk normally after surgery?</h3>
              <p>
                The goal of surgery is to improve function and prevent complications. Many patients experience improved mobility 
                after recovery, but this depends on the specific condition being treated and other factors. We'll work with you 
                to maximize your mobility through proper post-surgical care and rehabilitation.

              <h3>How can I prepare for diabetic foot surgery?</h3>
              <p>
                Preparation includes optimizing blood sugar control, following pre-surgical instructions regarding medications, 
                arranging for post-surgical assistance at home, and preparing your living space for a safe recovery. Our team will 
                provide detailed guidance specific to your procedure.
